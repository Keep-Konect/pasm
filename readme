# Pasm

**Pasm** is a project designed to provide a user-friendly alternative to emulators like Johny, which can be challenging to use due to its graphical user interface (GUI). In this project, we've eliminated the GUI and introduced several useful instructions for debugging purposes. We hope you find it helpful and enjoyable.

## Available Instructions:

1. `var [name] [value]`: Create a new variable with the specified name and initial value.

2. `inc [variable]`: Increment the value of the specified variable by one.

3. `dec [variable]`: Decrement the value of the specified variable by one.

4. `tst [variable]`: If the variable's value is equal to 0, jump to the next next line; otherwise, jump to the next line.

5. `jmp [line]`: Jump to the specified line number.

6. `print [variable]`: Print the current value of the specified variable to the console.

## To execute .pasm file :

`python3 pasm.py <file>`

Feel free to use these instructions to debug and analyze your code effectively. Enjoy using **Pseudo Asm**!
